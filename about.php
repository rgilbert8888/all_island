          <!-- <h4>A Family Company</h4> -->
          <p>All Island Equipment was established in 1970 by Gus Wade, a man with (and still has) a fierce determination to represent only the finest construction, paving, and municipal equipment available; to provide his customers with the type of service and product support that keep them coming back. Over the years, Gus instilled those same values in his sons, Gary and Daryl, who own and operate the business today.</p>
          <p>Located in West Babylon, New York, All Island Equipment is ideally situated to provide their customers with equipment from some of the world’s leading manufacturers including Leeboy, Kawasaki, Dynapac, Gehl, Kobelco, Takeuchi, Massey Ferguson, and others too numerous to mention. Over the last forty years the Wade family has built a reputation around giving contractors the quality equipment that they demand backed up with a commitment to customer satisfaction that’s second to none</p>
